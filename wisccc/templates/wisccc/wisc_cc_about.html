                <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Since 2020 this project, a collaboration between Michael Fields, UW-Madison, and The Nature
                        Conservancy, has addressed the need for locally relevant information on cover cropping as a key
                        strategy to build soil health and protect water quality in Wisconsin.
                        We see farmers as taking the lead in experimenting and
                        fine-tuning cover cropping to fit into Wisconsin's farm systems and
                        particular locations.
                        Our aim is to support farmers' creative adaptive capacity by providing them robust data and
                        stories from other farmers around the state who are working with cover crops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each year participating farmers provide information on their cover crop practices as well as
                        motivations, sources of support, and perceived benefits and barriers to cover cropping.
                        They also provide fall and spring biomass samples. As a participatory research effort, we are
                        learning
                        from growers about benefits, challenges, and results. We are using this data to inform policy,
                        research, and outreach to develop workable cover cropping strategies in Wisconsin's diverse
                        cropping systems, soil types, and microclimates.
                        We are also aggregating this information from around the state into other cover crop data sets
                        to improve decision support tools like SnapPlus, and to guide
                        practical cover crop recommendations.
                        Participating farmers receive personalized data on the amount of biomass their cover crop
                        produced as well as forage and nutrient analyses.

                    <p>A few highlights from our project:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Over a hundred farmers in over 60 counties around the state.</li>
                        <li> Biomass production in northern counties can be competitive with more southern farms.</li>
                        <li> Cereal rye and oats are favored, reliable cover crops, but multispecies mixes, often
                            including a legume, are the most popular cover crop among respondents.</li>
                        <li> Neighbors and producer-led grower groups are at the top of the list as sources of
                            information on cover cropping.</li>
                        <li>More data on the impacts of cover cropping on nutrient management is of interest to many
                            participants.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h5>Project Protocol</h5>
                    <p>
                        Each summer we send out invitations to join the survey via email to extension agricultural
                        educators, producer-led groups, land and water conservation county offices, and others.
                        Beginning in October, participating producers complete an online 35 question form regarding
                        cover cropping experiments and experience, including crops planted, dates,
                        seeding rates, fertility management and tillage.
                        We also ask about key sources of information and motivations to cover crop.
                        Beginning in fall 2023, participating farmers received a sampling kit, with a 2x2 quadrat of pvc
                        pipe
                        and clippers, along with instructions on how to cut a representative cover crop sample at the
                        soil surface.
                        Any weeds present are not separated from the samples.
                        Farmers sample in the fall and again in the spring.
                        The kit includes a scale and pre-addressed envelopes so that samples can be weighed in the field
                        and shipped to labs for biomass estimates and nutrient analyses.
                        At the end of the growing season we provide participants with
                        $100 honorarium as well as their personal biomass estimates and
                        nutrient information.
