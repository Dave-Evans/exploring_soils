Data category	Explanation
Note for sampling survey years 2020 through 2021	Dan Smith collected three samples at each farm using 0.5 meter quadrat, which were then dried, and weighed, and then reported in tons/acre.
Note for sampling survey years 2022	We had two methods: i)the nutrient analysis sample was collected via a 2x2 foot square and sent to the lab, and for biomass Dan Smith also collected three 0.5 meter2 samples, dried, weighed and reported results in tons per acre.
Note for sampling survey years 2023 and 2024	All samples were obtained via the farmers using a 2x2 foot square; farmers mailed in samples to Dairyland and AgSource labs, and the labs handled the samples after collection.
