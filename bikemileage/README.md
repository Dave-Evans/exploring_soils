## Bike mileage

An app for tracking the mileage and maintenance for different bicycles.

TODOs:

 - Write script to add data from CSVs to database.
	- Should be flexible enough to handle SQLite or Postgres
 - Display mileage in a table using Django Tables 2
 - Don't forget about the user here, need to make sure that user is logged in and part of models.
 - Make the table editable so we can change entries, perhaps using [this](https://joshuahunter.com/posts/using-bootstrap-buttons-with-django-tables2)
 - Add functionality to add a new entry, perhaps modeling off of what is in the books app
 - Build a graphing component
