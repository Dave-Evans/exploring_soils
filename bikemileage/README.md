## Bike mileage

An app for tracking the mileage and maintenance for different bicycles.

TODOs:

 - Create model and relatiionships for user, bicycle, and ride.
	- This implies a model for each as well as CRUD capability for Bicycle
 - Build a graphing component
 - 

 - **COMPLETE** Write script to add data from CSVs to database.
	- Should be flexible enough to handle SQLite or Postgres
 - **COMPLETE** Display mileage in a table using Django Tables 2
 - **COMPLETE** Make the table editable so we can change entries, perhaps using [this](https://joshuahunter.com/posts/using-bootstrap-buttons-with-django-tables2)
 - **COMPLETE** Add functionality to add a new entry, perhaps modeling off of what is in the books app
